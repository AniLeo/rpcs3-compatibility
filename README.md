# RPCS3's Compatibility List
Source code for [RPCS3.net/compatibility](https://rpcs3.net/compatibility), a small but powerful compatibility list for RPCS3.

## Features
- **Sort it:** Sort listed games by status, first character, region, last update date or by typing ID/Title in the searchbox.
- **Order it:** Order listed games by ID, Title, Commit, Status or Last Update date (ASC and DESC).
- **See more:** Click a commit to visit it or a game ID/Title to visit the forum thread about it.
- **History:** See changes made to a games' statuses from month-to-month with the History feature.
- **Better searching:** You don't need to search exactly by a game's title to find it. Levenshtein string comparisons assures the closest game is returned when no results are found and abbreviation search allows one to search by games using their abbreviations.
